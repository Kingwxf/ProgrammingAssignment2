## Caching the inverse of a matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Here are a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## Create a special matrix to cache the inverse of a matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
      m <- NULL
      set <- function(y) {
            x <<- y
            m <<- NULL
      }
      get <- function() x
      setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
      getinverse <- function() m
      list(set = set, get = get,
           setinverse = setinverse,
           getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
      m <- x$getinverse()
      if(!is.null(m)) {
            message("getting cached data")
            return(m)
      }
      data <- x$get()
      m <- solve(data, ...)
      x$setinverse(m)
      m  
}
